### How does heterogeneity in the population impact vaccine effectiveness?

#### Random Vaccination

* How effective is random vaccination at preventing endemicity in populations with varying degrees of heterogeneity (in transmission)? 
* Include a homogeneous population for comparison
* Random Vaccination = individual-based control
  + Vaccinated units are selected at random from the population
  + The exposure and transmission potential of vaccinated units is set to 0, all other units remain the same.
  
##### Vaccination of Heterogeneous Populations: from Lloyd-Smith *et al.* (2005)

* Individual-specific measures outperform population-wide control measures
  + Population-wide measures (e.g. social distancing) are measures which reduce the transmission potential of every unit in the population by a set factor, c. 
  $v_c = (1-c)*v$
  
  + Individual-specific measures (e.g. vaccination) are interventions in which a proportion, c, of individuals have their transmission potential reduced to 0 
  $v_c = 0$ for vaccinated individuals
  $v_c = v$ for remainder of population
  
* Individual-specific measures increase outbreak heterogeneity, whilst population-wide measures decrease heterogeneity. A higher degree of heterogeneity promotes stochastic extinction, as shown previously.
* For both Individual-Specific, and Population-Wide control the threshold control effort for guaranteed extinction is: $c â‰¥ 1 - 1/R0$
  
### Model Parameters

* Choose parameter scenarios which result in endemicity for all values of k, in the absence of vaccination: 
  + $R0 = 3$: Intermediate R0 value, with Herd Immunity: $1-1/R0 = 0.66$
  + $Rperiod = 1$: No long-lasting immunity, promotes endemicity
  
* Model Conditions:
  + Generations = 2000 : sufficient generations for model to reach equilibrium and long enough for vaccination to take effect
  + Reseeding = TRUE : preventing early stochastic extinction
  
* Vaccination parameters:
  + Vaccination coverage = 0.6 - 0.7 : Values over herd immunity threshold (0.66)
  + Vaccination strategy = Random : vaccinated units are chosen randomly
  + Vaccination start generation = 1500 : after equilibrium is reached, with 500 generations until the end of the model
  + Vaccination period = Infinity : Vacciantion lasts for the duration of the model

**Explanation** 

* With increasing heterogeneity, extinction occurs at lower vaccination coverage levels. 
* Useful metrics: 
  + What is the incidence of the endemic situations?
  + What do epidemic trajectories look like, for different k values?
  + If run for many simulations, are there any scenarios where HIT does not guarantee extinction?
